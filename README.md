# EAR PROJECT - EMERGENCY AUTOMATIC RESPIRATOR
This project was born because of CoVid19 pandemic.
The project Goal is to provide an emergency ventilator system to help CoVid19 serious cases using locally available resources.
This is an OPEN HARDWARE - OPEN SOURCE PROJECT.
The target is to run an entire ventilation system using an automotive car battery and an O2 can.
The initial project leader is Celso Ken Mori Monteiro, automotive designer with +30 yrs experience on automotive embedded systems
as OEM designer for customers as GM, Ford, VW, Fiat, Mercedes Benz, Scania, Navistar, Marcopolo, Agco...

The technology for first PCBs was downsized due to components availability in emerging countries so distributed production could be achieved even in small brazilian towns. The electronic parts are:
- PTH components
- Single-sided PCB, obtainable even by DIYs.

Basic concepts:
- FIO2 O2 + AIR mixer based on timed mechanical truck air valves and plastic bag container
- AMBU smasher based on car window motor due to availabilty and great mechanical characteristics
- ECU based on Arduino Pro Mini (the most available in emerging countries) and SPI based IO expension
- 2 motor drive options: relay (need second adjustable supply or buck) and PWM driven mosfet driver

Current Project Status:
- full HW schematics and system component's description available on "EAR System Developer's HW Guide", portuguese only version
- PCB Gerbers available, Single Side PTH version, Motor driver on relay option only. Time and size were underestimated because we no longer use these old technologies. Released on March 30, 2020.
- Mech prototype phase 2 aproved, torque is OK and current is low.
- Gerbers available of single sided boards on PTH components pending. Time and size were underestimated because we no longer use these old technologies. 
- EAR System Developer's SW Guide released on March 30, 2020.
- EAR Hardware prototypes finished and tested OK on April 2, 2020. Relay driver was used.
- EAR FW00 - firmware for HW testing purposes released on April 3, 2020.


Pending:
- Final mechanical prototype expected for Week 14
